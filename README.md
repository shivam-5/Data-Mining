# Data-Mining

1. Data analysis: 

  - Contains ways of handling missing data and thier prediction analysis
  - Finding appropriate k for kmeans clustering in unsupervised learning of unclustered dataset
  
  
2. OneR classification:
 
  - Builds a set of classification rules using oneR OneR method
  
  
3. Regression comparison:

  - Compare custom implementation of regression using gradient descent with scikit learn regression
  - Comparison done over predefined dataset as well as synthetic dataset
  
  
4. Implementaion of Kmeans algorithm with provision of retrieving WC and BC distance metrices
